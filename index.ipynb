    "Previously, you looked at all the requirements for running an OLS simple linear regression using Statsmodels. You worked with the height-weight data set to understand the process and all of the necessary steps that must be performed. In this lab , you'll explore a slightly more complex example to study the impact of spending on different advertising channels on total sales.\n",

There is obvious heteroscdasticity in the residuals for both variables. \n",

    "In this lab, you ran a complete regression analysis with a simple dataset. You used statsmodel to perform linear regression and evaluated your models using statistical metrics. You also looked for the regression assumptions before and after the analysis phase. Finally, you created some visualizations of your models and checked their goodness of fit. "
